  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Project purpose**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Development, maintenance, quality assurance and promotion of open source Modelica libraries to provide Modelica model components in many domains based on standardized interface definitions.

  There are three categories of libraries developed in this project:

  Category 1 Standard Libraries under strict release and maintenance conditions

  Category 2 Libraries that are standard conformant with limited release and maintenance support

  Category 3 Libraries that are not standard conformant with limited release and maintenance support

  The corresponding libraries are listed in Annex 1.

**Project rules**

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The project rules are according to the rules of the Modelica Association Bylaws. In particular:

  **Project members**

  Membership in this project is open to individual persons, companies, institutes, universities and other organizations, which agree to support the purpose of this project and follow the project rules.\
  An organizational member has to appoint an individual person affiliated to the organization to represent the organization in all matters related to this project. This person is the organization’s liaison member.

  Project members are divided into two groups that have different rights:

  *Group 1: Library Officers*

  The library officers are listed in Annex 2.

  1.  For every library or sublibrary of Category 1, two or more library officers are assigned that are responsible for the maintenance and for the further organization of the development. Other members may also contribute, but the final decision for library improvements and/or changes is performed by the responsible library officers. If a library is maintained by several library officers, they shall perform a decision by voting. A positive vote requires a qualified majority of the respective library officers of this library or sublibrary (see below).\
      Library officers have to be personal members of the MA.

  2.  Library officers are assigned in one of the following ways:

  -   When a new library or sublibrary is provided, a copyright transfer contract has to be signed between the contributor(s) and the Modelica Association, or the contributor(s) assigns an appropriate license to the Modelica Association. In this contract the initial library officers might be defined.

  -   New library officers can be assigned by the project members for the same library/sublibrary, with a qualified majority of all project members, and provided no other decision stands against it.

  -   Initial library officers may be defined (if not defined in a copyright transfer or license contract), library officers may be removed and/or new library officers may be appointed, if library officers resign and/or library officers do not work well for the further development of the library and/or do not work in the interest of this project. All such decisions shall be approved by all project members with a qualified majority.

  1.  In order that a library or sublibrary is ready to be released, the responsible library officers have to report the changes to all project members (usually via the release notes). Feedback and improvement suggestions shall be taken into account. The library shall be made available for beta testing to interested parties before a final decision. Modelica libraries of this project shall only use language elements of the published Modelica language specifications. A new release is formally decided by a qualified majority of all project members (see below). Electronic voting is possible and is performed according to §14 of the Modelica Bylaws.

  *Group 2: Advisory Members*

  The Advisory Members are listed in Annex 3.

  1.  Consists of personal and organizational members,\
      e.g. but not limited to tool vendors, library developers and experienced users.

  2.  Contribute to the development, maintenance, quality assurance and promotion of Modelica Libraries maintained by this Modelica Project.

  3.  The Advisory Members group is open for additional members that fulfill the following requirements:.\
      Applicants must have participated at least at two library meetings in the last 24 months, or distribute one or more libraries of this project with a released product (tool or library).\
      All project members decide about the membership with simple majority (see below).

  *Project Leader and Project Deputy*

  The Project Leader and the Project Deputy are listed in Annex 4.

  All project members elect a project leader and a project deputy for 2 years with qualified majority (see below). The project leader and the project deputy have to be members of the Modelica Association.

  The project leader has to organize meetings (at least 4 per year, in person or via web / phone), organize the releases in conformance with the library officers, and report to MA.

  Whenever a critical issue cannot be decided within MAP-Lib, the project leader has to ask the MA board for advice or a decision.

  The project deputy has to support the project leader and to stand in for the project leader whenever the project leader is unable to take over his duties.

  **Voting**

  Voting is performed by all project members according to § 14 of the MA Bylaws,\
  but with a quorum of 9 project members.\
  At least 5 of these members have to be Library Officers, and one of these members has to be either the project leader or the project deputy. Every voting can be performed electronically according to § 14 of the MA Bylaws.

  “Working days” are defined as in the MA Bylaws.

  **Meetings**\
  Library meetings are announced in the respective mailing lists:\
  [*map-lib@modelica.org*](mailto:map-lib@modelica.org), [*modelica-design@modelica.org*](mailto:modelica-design@modelica.org).

  The meeting material (minutes, documents, presentations) is available on the private MAP-Lib repository. A publication of this material needs approval of all participants of the respective meeting.

  **Release Process for Libraries of Category 1**

  -   A new main version of these libraries should be released once a year typically around March 15^th^.

  -   A maintenance version of these libraries should be released once a year typically around Sept. 15^th^.

  -   The whole process from first alpha version to the final release should not take longer than 2 months.

  -   Minor bugs or missing components shall not block the release. These pieces of work shall be included in the following release or maintenance release.

  -   The quality of the libraries is assured by regression testing with at least 2 different tools, in comparison with the previous version. The advisory members shall support the release process actively, especially the regression tests. Further quality assurance tests might be added.

  The Release Schedule for libraries of category 1 is given in annex 5. Changes to this release schedule have to be approved by all project members with qualified majority.

  Libraries of Category 1 do not necessarily have to be released as monolithic libraries. As soon as a mechanism for modular distribution is available and accepted by all project members with qualified majority, these libraries can be released in granular modules.

  **Release Process for Libraries of Category 2 and 3**

  Development and maintenance of libraries of Category 2 and 3 is organized by the developers individually. However, the developers have to guarantee that these libraries are consistent with the libraries of Category 1.

  When a new library should be included in Category 2 or 3, or a library should be raised to a higher Category, the library has to be reviewed by all project members and approved by a qualified majority of all project members.
