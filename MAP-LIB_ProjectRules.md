# 3 Project Purpose #

Development, maintenance, quality assurance and promotion of open source
Modelica libraries to provide Modelica model components in many domains
based on standardized interface definitions.

## 3.1 Covered Libraries ##

Any library that should be covered by MAP-LIB needs approval of the
Project Members by [qualified majority](#52-voting) of the Project Members.

Libraries that are covered by MAP-LIB are listed in [Annex 1](#annex-1-libraries-covered-by-map-lib).

# 4 License of Project Results #

All Modelica libraries of this project must be published under the BSD
3-Clause License. The license text is available from:
<https://modelica.org/licenses/modelica-3-clause-bsd>

Whenever somebody submits a contribution to this project, he/she accepts
that it may be published by the Modelica Association (MA) under the BSD
3-Clause License, even without explicit approval.

New releases of libraries covered by MAP-LIB have to be sent to MA for
approval according to §2 of MA Bylaws.

# 5 Project Rules #

The project rules are according to the rules of the MA bylaws. In
particular:

## 5.1 Membership ##

### 5.1.1 Project Members ###

Membership in this project is open to individual persons, companies,
institutes, universities and other organizations, which agree to support
the purpose of this project and follow the project rules.

An organizational MA member has to appoint an individual person
affiliated to the organization to represent the organization in all
matters related to this project. This person is the organization's
liaison member.

Membership applications shall be sent to the Project Leader. The Project
Leader informs the Project Members about this request. If no Project Member
brings up concerns within one week, the membership application is accepted.
If a concern is raised, as well as for membership application of neither
MA members nor organization's liaison members a vote is required with a
[qualified majority](#52-voting) of the Project Members.

The Project Members are listed in [Annex 2](#annex-2-project-members).

### 5.1.2 Library Officers ###

1.  For every library or sublibrary covered by MAP-LIB , two or more
    Library Officers are assigned that are responsible for the
    maintenance and for the further organization of the development.
    Other people may also contribute, but the final decision for
    library improvements and/or changes is performed by the
    responsible Library Officers. If a library is maintained by
    several Library Officers, they shall approve the proposed changes
    to find a consensus.

2.  Library Officers are assigned in one of the following ways:

    a.  When a new library or sublibrary is provided, a copyright
        transfer contract has to be signed between the contributor(s)
        and the MA or the contributor(s) assigns an appropriate
        license to the MA. In this contract the initial Library
        Officers might be defined. Once available, the MA Contributor
        License Agreement (CLA) has to be signed by all contributors.

    b.  New Library Officers can be assigned by the Project Members for
        the same library/sublibrary, with a [qualified majority](#52-voting)
        of all Project Members.

    c.  Initial Library Officers may be defined (if not defined in a
        copyright transfer or license contract), library officers may
        be removed and/or new Library Officers may be appointed, if
        Library Officers resign and/or library officers are inactive
        to the extent that it damages the further development of the
        library and/or do not work in the interest of this project.
        Decisions on Library Officers changes shall be approved by the
        Project Members with a [qualified majority](#52-voting).

3.  All Library Officers need to be Project Members.

4.  In order that a library or sublibrary is ready to be released, the
    responsible Library Officers have to report the changes to all
    Project Members (usually via the release notes). Feedback and
    improvement suggestions shall be taken into account.

The Library Officers are listed in [Annex 3](#annex-3-library-officers).

### 5.1.3 Project Leader and Project Deputy ###

All Project Members elect a Project Leader and a Project Deputy for two
years with [qualified majority](#52-voting). The Project Leader and the
Project Deputy have to be individual members of the MA.

The Project Leader has to organize meetings (typically, six per year; in
person or online), organize the releases in conformance with the library
officers, maintain the Annexes of the project rules and report to MA.

The Project Deputy has to support the Project Leader and to stand in for
the Project Leader whenever the Project Leader is unable to fulfill
his/her duties.

Whenever an issue arises where no consensus (based on a qualified
majority) can be found within MAP-LIB, the Project Leader has to ask the
MA Board for advice or a decision. Failing this, the Project Members can
(based on a [qualified majority](#52-voting)) ask the MA Board to trigger an
extraordinary election for the Project Leader/Deputy.

The Project Leader and the Project Deputy are listed in [Annex 4](#annex-4-project-leader-and-project-deputy).

## 5.2 Voting ##

Voting is performed by all Project Members according to §14 of the MA
Bylaws, but with a quorum of 7 Project Members. At least 4 of these
members have to be Library Officers.

## 5.3 Meetings ##

Project meetings have to be announced at least one week in advance in
the respective mailing lists. The mailing lists are defined in the
[Annex 5](#annex-5-mailing-lists) and should reach
at least all Project Members and MA members.

The meeting material (e.g., minutes, documents, presentations) is
accessible to all members of the MA.

## 5.4 Library Releases ##

Releases of libraries covered by MAP-LIB can be initiated in two ways:

1.  The Project Leader or the Project Deputy initiates a new release.
2.  A Library Officer suggests the initiation of a new release. The
    Project Members then vote on having a new release as suggested by
    the Library Officer. A positive vote requires a [qualified majority](#52-voting)
    of the Project Members.

A Recommendation for a Release Process for libraries is given in
 [Annex 6](#annex-6-recommendation-for-a-release-process-for-libraries)
and a Recommended Release Schedule for libraries is given in
 [Annex 7](#annex-7-recommended-release-schedule).
